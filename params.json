Then, using the R package cummeRbund, various plots are created on-the fly. \r\n\r\nThere are three subdirectories, containing the server.R and ui.R files required for all Shiny apps, and a load_packages.R file to handle loading dependencies.\r\n\r\n<b>gene_expression_panel_cuffdiff:</b>\r\n\r\nTakes a cuffdiff database (rebuilding if required) and displays information on a single named gene (as defined by the gene short name or the XLOC number). After the gene information is defined, gene expression plots can be restricted by sample.\r\n\r\n<b>To use</b>: Open the server.R or ui.R file within RStudio. Click on the \"Run App\" button, or run from the R console:\r\n\r\n<code>shiny::runApp('shiny_cuffdiff/gene_expression_panel_cuffdiff'))</code>\r\n\r\nType the path to the cuffdiff directory <br />\r\nType the gene short name or XLOC number <br />\r\nPress \"Plot\"\r\n\r\n<b>gene_comparison_panel_cuffdiff:</b>\r\n\r\nTakes a cuffdiff database (rebuilding if required) and displays information on a set of named genes (as defined by the gene short name or the XLOC number). Displays a heatmap and a barplot. After the gene information is defined, gene expression plots can be restricted by sample.\r\n\r\n<b>To use</b>: Open the server.R or ui.R file within RStudio. Click on the \"Run App\" button, or run from the R console:\r\n\r\n<code>shiny::runApp('shiny_cuffdiff/gene_comparison_panel_cuffdiff'))</code>\r\n\r\nType the path to the cuffdiff directory <br />\r\nType the gene short names or XLOC numbers <br />\r\nPress \"Plot\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Contributors and Users:</b> Welcome. We intend to use the Git branching model described in this post for development of this code.\r\n\r\nhttp://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ (Thanks to Vincent Driessen for the post).\r\n\r\nPut simply, <br />\r\n..if you just want to try the code out but don't want to contribute to the code, clone the <b>master</b> branch <br />\r\n..if you want to contribute to the code, clone the <b>develop</b> branch, and please read the above post.\r\n\r\n<b>Users:</b> Please note that, while this code is usable and may already be helpful when interrogating your gene expression results, it is a project at an early stage of development and there is a lot of error handling and code optimisation to be done.\r\n\r\n<b>Contributors:</b> Welcome and thanks! Please take the time to read the current issues list, and feel free to create new issues or suggestions for improvements.\r\n\r\n<b>Requirements (tested on these versions)</b>\r\n\r\nR version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) -- \"Fire Safety\" <br />\r\nRStudio (open source edition) <br />\r\nR package: Shiny version\t0.13.0 (this is installed during the startup process) <br />\r\nR package: cummeRbund version 2.12.0 (this is installed during the startup process) <br />\r\nA valid cuffdiff directory (the cuffdiff.db can be rebuilt, but this is a very, very slow process, so this option is turned off by default)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are also developing Shiny code to interrogate the outputs of other common gene expression / differential expression workflows (intially starting with DESeq2), which will be published as a separate repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
