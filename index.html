<p>Welcome to the shiny_cuffdiff project. Version 0.2 (with improved file import, graphics, and feedback) will be released soon!</p>

<p>This project is at an early phase of development, but is under active development.</p>

<p>Participants (either users, testers, or code developers) are encouraged!</p>

<p>Put simply, this code uses the outputs of the Tuxedo workflow (Tophat2 &gt; Cufflinks &gt; Cuffdiff) which is a cuffdiff SQL database file called cuffdiff.db. Then, using the R package cummeRbund, various plots are created on-the fly. </p>

<p>There are three subdirectories, containing the server.R and ui.R files required for all Shiny apps, and a load_packages.R file to handle loading dependencies.</p>

<p><b>gene_expression_panel_cuffdiff:</b></p>

<p>Takes a cuffdiff database (rebuilding if required) and displays information on a single named gene (as defined by the gene short name or the XLOC number). After the gene information is defined, gene expression plots can be restricted by sample.</p>

<p><b>To use</b>: Open the server.R or ui.R file within RStudio. Click on the "Run App" button, or run from the R console:</p>

<p><code>shiny::runApp('shiny_cuffdiff/gene_expression_panel_cuffdiff'))</code></p>

<p>Type the path to the cuffdiff directory <br>
Type the gene short name or XLOC number <br>
Press "Plot"</p>

<p><b>gene_comparison_panel_cuffdiff:</b></p>

<p>Takes a cuffdiff database (rebuilding if required) and displays information on a set of named genes (as defined by the gene short name or the XLOC number). Displays a heatmap and a barplot. After the gene information is defined, gene expression plots can be restricted by sample.</p>

<p><b>To use</b>: Open the server.R or ui.R file within RStudio. Click on the "Run App" button, or run from the R console:</p>

<p><code>shiny::runApp('shiny_cuffdiff/gene_comparison_panel_cuffdiff'))</code></p>

<p>Type the path to the cuffdiff directory <br>
Type the gene short names or XLOC numbers <br>
Press "Plot"</p>

<p><b>Contributors and Users:</b> Welcome. We intend to use the Git branching model described in this post for development of this code.</p>

<p><a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a> (Thanks to Vincent Driessen for the post).</p>

<p>Put simply, <br>
..if you just want to try the code out but don't want to contribute to the code, clone the <b>master</b> branch <br>
..if you want to contribute to the code, clone the <b>develop</b> branch, and please read the above post.</p>

<p><b>Users:</b> Please note that, while this code is usable and may already be helpful when interrogating your gene expression results, it is a project at an early stage of development and there is a lot of error handling and code optimisation to be done.</p>

<p><b>Contributors:</b> Welcome and thanks! Please take the time to read the current issues list, and feel free to create new issues or suggestions for improvements.</p>

<p><b>Requirements (tested on these versions)</b></p>

<p>R version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) -- "Fire Safety" <br>
RStudio (open source edition) <br>
R package: Shiny version    0.13.0 (this is installed during the startup process) <br>
R package: cummeRbund version 2.12.0 (this is installed during the startup process) <br>
A valid cuffdiff directory (the cuffdiff.db can be rebuilt, but this is a very, very slow process, so this option is turned off by default)</p>
